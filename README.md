# UDACITY Project_2 - My-Portfolio README

# Program Overview

The following files generate a website to display a dynamic portfolio/resume website.  At this time all of the links point to my resume as there are no projects to display, and I have no links for my previous software developer experience since it was from 1998 - 2001.  I plan to populate the links with the projects that I complete in the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, and also with projects that I am volunteering for with AT&T (my current employer).

Included Files

There are two main files and several supporting files from Bootstrap
> 1.	index.html: Location: my-portfolio/docs/html/index.html: This HTML file was modified/created using a Bootstrap template and modified for my portfolio.
> 2.	jumbotron-narrow.css: Location: my-portfolio/docs/css/jumbotron-narrow.css: This CSS file was modified/created using a Bootstrap template and modified for my portfolio.
> 3.	ALL OTHER FILES: Located in various directories. All other files are the Bootstrap CSS support files and I have not modified them.

# Accessing/Opening the Project

Open the index.html: Location: my-portfolio/docs/html/index.html from your favorite browser.
> NOTE: Three screen shots of what the portfolio should look like are located in the same directory as the README.md file that you are reading now, and are titled 1) portfolio-full-screen.png, and 2) portfolio-Nexus-5X-part1.png, and 3) portfolio-Nexus-5X-part2.png.

# Modifications

Feel free to modify the index.html and the jumbotron-narrow.css file for your own portfolio. Please leave a comment if you do so I can check out your creativity!

# Credits

Although I modified the index.html and jumbotron-narrow.css files, these were templates and all other files were created by Bootstrap for which I'm very greatful for them letting the public use and modify them freely.
